# Workshop Machine Learning for Research 2020
### Advancing research through machine learning: an applied coding workshop  

Time and place
Workshop: 20-24 January, 2020  
Python & Jupyter notebook crash course (optional): January 17, 2020  
Address: SURF/Netherlands eScience Center, Science Park 140, Amsterdam

## Scope of this workshop:
During this workshop we worked with 6 selected teams from different domains on questions and data that each team brought to us.
The key focus was to explore if (and how) machine-learning could help to address the research questions.

## Presentations:
Most of the workshop week was reserved for actual hands-on work. But this was complemented by a number of presentations on different aspects of machine-learning. 
You can find the slides of the two introduction lectures by Maxwell Cai (SURF) and Florian Huber (eScience Center) here: https://github.com/NLeSC/machine_learning_workshop/tree/master/Presentations.  
The Tuesday presentation by Vincent Warmerdam was not recorded, but he also gave this lecture at pyData which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8MEFI7ZJlA&t=932s.

## Aim and eligibility
Are you a researcher and do you have a challenging research question that might benefit from machine learning, deep learning or AI? And do you have the data to start working on this question? If so, this workshop is for you.
Tell us about your idea and your team (3-5 people). We will invite up to five teams to spend a week of hands-on work with two machine learning experts. Together, we will explore your data in order to find the best machine learning strategy with which to tackle your scientific question. The workshop will be a collaborative effort in which we will share knowledge, develop and explore new ideas and boost your understanding of current machine learning techniques.
At least two team members should be based at a Dutch university or research institute that is affiliated with NWO or KNAW. Proposals can come from any scientific domain.

## Requirements
+	A team
This workshop is a collaborative effort and we ask for submissions from teams of between 3 and 5 people. Your fellow members should all share a strong interest in the proposed research question, but may be as diverse as you like and can range from students to professors and include different disciplines, faculties, levels of expertise, etc. We strongly encourage submissions from teams comprising a diverse mix of researchers from different universities or institutes. 
+	Data
To get the most out of this one-week workshop, the data you want to work with must be available for use during the workshop. Before accepting a proposal, we may ask you to let us briefly inspect the data in order to make sure it is ready to be used for hands-on work during the workshop. If you are unsure whether your data is suitable, please don’t hesitate to contact us before applying. 
+	Basic programming skills
We do not expect expert-level programming skills or prior experience with machine learning, as long as you are keen to learn new things. However, at least some team members should have basic programming experience so that we can focus on actual hands-on work during the workshop. Since we will work in very small teams, we can easily adapt to your level of expertise.
If you’re still worried you might not have the right computational skills, please feel free to contact us. 

Submissions will be reviewed by a diverse team of machine learning practitioners (working on a broad range of scientific projects at the Netherlands eScience Center). The final selection of a maximum of 5 teams will be made based on:
1. Quality and novelty of the proposed research. 
2. Match between the available data and the scientific question(s) asked. 
3. Extent to which this project benefits the applying teams’ skills and knowledge.
4. Our own expected ability to give the proposed project a boost regarding digital technologies.
